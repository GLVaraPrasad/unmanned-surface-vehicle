# Remotely Operated Aquatic Surface Vehicle

This project demonstrates the design and development of a low-cost, remotely operated unmanned surface vehicle (USV) for aquatic weed cutting and floating debris collection in small to medium-sized freshwater bodies.

## 🚀 Features

- **RF-Controlled Operation**: 250-meter range using FlySky 8-channel transmitter.
- **Dual Propulsion**: Two 12V DC motors with 3D-printed propeller wheels for navigation.
- **Conveyor Mechanism**: Remotely controlled belt system to collect floating debris.
- **Weed Cutting System**: Sickle-type blades driven by a servo motor for efficient weed removal.
- **Lightweight Design**: Constructed using acrylic sheets, 3D-printed parts, and hollow PVC tubes for buoyancy.
